# Meta Fu
According to Wikipedia (so it's gotta be true, right?) ...
```quote
In Chinese, the term kung fu refers to any skill that is acquired through learning or practice.
```

Anyway, this project has snippets of code demonstrating compile time (aka meta) programming.

The demonstration is usually in the form of _trying_ to compile the simple apps.
